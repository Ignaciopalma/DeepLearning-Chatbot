T: 	Uh-huh. The general- You have a force that produces and acceleration here. You have gravity producing the acceleration or weight.

S: 	Oh, you mean F equals ma.

T: 	So you could use you generalized F equals ma. You can divide that up into two pieces. The asuby which we don’t need to worry about. In the y-direction, the normal force exactly counters the y-component of gravity. We know from- We know from our physical intuition that the block is not going

[inaudible]

hop off the slide and it’s not going to sink into the slide. That’s the constraint. That it stays on the slide.

S: 	So we know that

T: 	asubx equals- Go ahead.

S: 	asubx will equal should we call it big W again.

T: 	Yeah and do you want to say asubx times m.

S: 	O.k. asubx times

T: 	And here when it could be

[inaudible]

S: 	I’m thinking here. It’s going to be the acceleration is the

[pause 6sec]

well it’s the component of the

[pause 5sec]

It’s a vector component of the downward

T: 	Uh-huh. It’s the x-component of the gravity.

S: 	O.k. So What are we going to call that downward component? The overall

T: 	That’s up to you.

S: 	I guess we’ll call it w w.

T: 	We’ll label w on the graph somehow. Which way does w pull? I’d call it w

S: 	This you mean?

T: 	O.k. You want to call that- That’s excellent. Call the force of gravity, the force of the weight w there. O.k. O.k. So asubx isn’t equal to w, it’s equal to the x-component of w divided by the mass.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	F equals ma. a equals F over m. There’s just one force in the x-direction. The x-component of W.

[pause 8sec]

S: 	Now push delete?

E: 	Yeah. Yeah. You got hold that over where the asubx is.

T: 	O.k. I’m going to be quiet for a minute while you guys straighten it out.

E: 	Just hit the delete key. The delete. Yeah. Well that one.

S: 	O.k.

[pause 9sec]

O.k. then

[pause 5sec]

The asubx is equal to

T: 	Go ahead.

S: 	W sine of thirty-seven divided by the mass of the object.

T: 	That’s excellent.

S: 	So, we know what, we can solve for w I believe. Because we know We’re not exact, we’re solving

T: 	Go ahead.

S: 	asubx isn’t Oh wait, asubx would in fact be what we’re solving for all together.

T: 	That’s right. We’re solving for the mag- You want the magnitude of the acceleration and the direction. You know the direction. It’s down slope.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	The magnitude is going to be w sine thirty-seven

[inaudible]

S: 	w equals, um

T: 	If you’re confused in a case like this, where there’s cosine or sine, One thing I do, I imagine, what if that angle were zero. Well the acceleration along the slope should be zero. If that were a flat surface, that wouldn’t slide at all. Right. So then it’s got to be sine. It would have to be sine of zero to produce a zero acceleration. So that is exactly the right thing to use is the sine.

S: 	O.k. Now, we’re trying to solve for. Now wait, the w here

T: 	Yeah. What’s the w?

S: 	w is sixty

T: 	That’s only in terms of, that’s only in terms of

S: 	Newtons.

T: 	Numbers. What don’t we interpret the mass. Interpret the two blocks together.

S: 	It’s mass times gravity.

T: 	O.k. What happens when you take mass times gravity, What happens when you take W over m?

S: 	Um, you’re totally totally leaving m out then.

T: 	That’s right. The m cancels. So you just get g sine thirty-seven degrees.

S: 	So.

T: 	Yeah. So it’s best, it’s almost always best to go as far as you can with the algebra before you, um put in any numbers at all. Because sometimes you get a cancellation. You don’t want to have to bother multiplying by sixty and dividing by sixty or whatever. If you can avoid it

S: 	O.k.

[pause 4sec]

I guess we’ll jut leave gravity at ten again.

T: 	Uh-huh. Yeah. We can use 9.8. It doesn’t matter. We could pretend that it’s ten.

S: 	

[inaudible]

[pause 17sec]

S: 	I’ll just solve for that on the calculator.

T: 	O.k.

[pause 10sec]

Using 9.8 is fine. The main thing is in a problem, be consistent throughout. Either use one or the other.

S: 	O.k.

[pause 7sec]

5.9, I guess is the best approximation meters per second.

T: 	Yeah. And you’ve got the direction marked already. So that part A is done. Actually you say asubx, and you drew the x-axis opposite. There should be a minus sign. It’s clear in the diagram, but it’s not

S: 	Yes it’s downwards and should be in the negative direction.

T: 	You could say a equals 5.9 meters per second squared or asubx equals minus 5.9

S: 	O.k.

T: 	a just being the magnitude of the acceleration.

S: 	Magnitude. O.k. I guess we go on to the next one.

T: 	Uh-huh.

[pause 8sec]

S: 	The next question is, "What is the magnitude of the normal force acting?" Well

T: 	On the top one

[inaudible]

Go ahead.

S: 	The top block. Would it hurt to get rid of these?

T: 	Not at all It’ll in fact. Don’t get rid of the a. Keep that handy.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	Because that a is the same for the top block and the bottom block. They move together.

S: 	O.k.

E: 	Just hit the delete key.

S: 	O.k. The normal force, is that the force that the lower one is forcing on the top one?

T: 	Yeah. That’s the force that sticks straight out of the- Normal force means the normal to the surface, perpendicular to the surface. So that force stick straight up.

S: 	So this right here.

T: 	Yeah. The contact force is the force between the two blocks. The portion of the contact force that sticks straight up or straight at a right angle to the surface where they contact is called the normal force.

S: 	So just call that N?

T: 	Uh-huh.

S: 	Capital or

T: 	Yeah. Capital And that’s a force on which block?

S: 	That’s a force on the smaller block?

T: 	That’s the smaller block, yeah,

S: 	On the top block.

T: 	I would usually draw it starting where the smaller block is. Write like a dot representing the smaller block.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	Or a little blob representing the smaller block. Do a free body diagram.

S: 	O.k. I understand that. Now they want to know what the magnitude of this force is.

T: 	Uh-huh. So we’re starting with what kind of information? We have then acceleration of the block because it’s the same as the acceleration of the two block system.

S: 	Yes.

T: 	We have, we can figure out weight of the block. And we know the mass of the block. So we have acceleration and mass and we want a force. What’s the relationship we use?

S: 	F equals ma.

T: 	Exactly right. Some of the forces on the top block equals the mass of the top block times the acceleration of the top block. O.k. So set that up.

S: 	So in other words, we’re solving for normal by F equals ma.

T: 	Uh-huh. And you’re going to have to list forces on the top block.

S: 	Oh, right now?

T: 	Well at some point to write it down.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	You can say sum of the forces, but when you write down the m, you’re going to write down the other forces too. So do it in whichever order feels intuitive to you.

S: 	I’m getting confused I think.

T: 	Yeah. Get yourself unconfused.

S: 	O.k. T You might want to write- Are you in equation mode now?

S: 	Yeah.

T: 	You might want to write down your F equals ma there. O.k Think of that as a vector equation. You might want to write the word vector next to it a couple of spaces over. O.k. Now I’m going to tell you, you don’t have to keep the same axes for this part of the problem as you did for the last. Remember that it’s almost always a good choice to put an axis in the direction of an unknown you’re solving for.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	What’s the unknown you’re solving for in part B?

S: 	N.

T: 	So you should make a new axis, a new set of axes.

[pause 12sec]

Exactly.

[pause 7sec]

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. So now your N is in the y-direction. O.k. So that F equals ma is going to be Fsuby equals masuby and Fsubx equals masubx. So why don’t we lean to look at one of those equations. Because we picked the y-direction to be the same as the normal force

S: 	O.k.

T: 	We only need to look at the y-equation to solve for the normal force.

S: 	The y-equation. You mean y.

T: 	Yeah the sum of the forces in the y-direction equals m times the y-component of the acceleration.

[pause 10sec]

S: 	Trying to get into equation mode here.

[pause 6sec]

y equals m times a.

T: 	m times asuby. asuby is not going to be the same thing as a here.

[pause 9sec]

O.k.

[pause 23sec]

S: 	O.k. Fsuby equals the mass times acceleration in the y-direction.

T: 	Uh-huh.

S: 	So when we wrote down the acceleration in the last problem, we didn’t solve for asuby.

T: 	In the last one, no You mean in the last

S: 	Oh, this is a different asub though. We used different coordinates.

T: 	Yeah. Yeah. It’s the same a as part A, but um your axes have changed. So asubx, asuby will be different. Still the same vector, but the representation of it’s components will be different.

S: 	So asuby is just acceleration due to gravity this time.

T: 	No. It’s the y-component of that vector a.

S: 	Oh, it’s how fast the object is going down.

T: 	It’s how fast that object is accelerating down. Do you have an object there? Anything, a calculator in your hand. Anything that you can put in your hand that has a feelable weight.

S: 	As is slides down the plane, it’s going- It’s accelerating in the x and y-direction.

T: 	That’s exactly right. Yes. If you have a calculator or note pad or something put it in your hand. When you pull your hand down, it feels lighter. The normal, the force between and thing gets less. The component of the acceleration down affects that normal force.

S: 	So what we have to do is write that acceleration component into y.

T: 	Yeah. You’re going to have to find the acceleration- The component of the acceleration in the downward direction- the y-direction. And you know that, you know that the acceleration is thirty-seven degrees below the horizontal. You know that it’s parallel to the slope and you know the magnitude of it. So find the asuby. It’s just finding the component of a vector which you probably spent about two weeks doing in class I would think. Maybe a month, I don’t know.

S: 	So let me look real quick and draw that vector.

T: 	Yeah. You haven’t drawn that, the asuby.

S: 	No, I mean a.

T: 	No, you have the a there. All you need to do is take y-component of it.

S: 	Why isn’t it

[inaudible]

E: 	Here. Let’s see. Uh, let’s see.

S: 	I’ve overloaded it.

T: 	You have everything drawn that you need.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. Look at your a and your negative y-axis.

S: 	Uh-huh.

T: 	O.k. See your a pointing down slope? Your negative y-axis over to the right of it.

S: 	Yeah. Yeah.

T: 	Alright, just draw a line straight from the head of the arrow. Draw a mental line straight horizontally to the y-axis. O.k. And look. Look at that triangle.

S: 	From what? The head of the

T: 	From the head of the a. The little triangle at the end of the a. Yes. O.k. Good. Look at the triangle. You don’t have to draw a vector there, but just mentally draw a triangle. Yeah, You don’t need a name for it. That’s just a marker. O.k. So look at the triangle that’s formed. O.k.

S: 	O.k. I made a right triangle.

T: 	Right. See the right hand side of that triangle is asuby.

S: 	Yes.

T: 	The bottom side is asubx. And the hypotenuse is the vector a. O.k. So your Look at the triangle they form. What’s the angle between what you’ve labeled ax and the side a?

S: 	That will be thirty-seven.

T: 	Thirty-seven degrees. So asuby. Is that opposite or adjacent to thirty seven degrees?

S: 	It’s opposite

T: 	Opposite

S: 	So you would use sine.

T: 	Right. So asuby equals

[pause 5sec]

S: 	asuby

T: 	Now is this the plus y or minus y-axis?

S: 	Minus y.

T: 	Right. So asuby equals minus a times

S: 	Minus a times sine thirty-seven.

T: 	Excellent. O.k. So now you’ve got asuby in terms of things

[inaudible]

a you already know is 5.9 meters per second squared.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. Now, Fsuby equals masuby. You know m. You know asuby. Now all you have to do is separate that Fsuby into there’s the and there’s another force in the Y direction. What’s the other force in the y-direction?

S: 	The other force?

T: 	Uh-huh. The other force in the y-direction. What would happen to the block if there weren’t any normal force? If you took out the block that was under it. If you took away the whole- If that block were just sitting there with nothing under it, what would happen?

S: 	It would fall down.

T: 	Right. What would make it fall down?

S: 	Acceleration.

T: 	Not acceleration, but it would grav- The weight would make it fall down.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	The force of gravity

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. So that’s the other force. The normal force pushing it up. Gravity pulling it down. The difference between will give you the- the vector sum will give you acceleration in the y-direction.

S: 	So if you were to say.

T: 	N’s good.

S: 	N plus weight .

T: 	N, yeah. Nsuby plus weightsuby. Is the weight going to pull up or down?

S: 	The weight’s going to pull down.

T: 	Right.

S: 	We can get rid of that minus.

T: 	Forget the suby and say N minus the weight if you want. Because the y-component of the weight is, weight pulls down. You might want to put a diagram

[inaudible]

S: 	So N minus y is going to equal

T: 	Yeah. N minus W. That’s you Fsuby.

S: 	O.k. That makes sense.

T: 	And now you can connect that to your asuby. And then you can and now you can solve for the N. So I’ll be quiet for a minute and let you sort it out.

S: 	Solving for Nsuby.

T: 	Yeah. Yeah. Go up to equations. Fsuby equals what?

S: 	Equals. O.k.

T: 	And asuby and you know what asuby is. First solve for N. While you’ve still got it in simple form- N equals instead of

S: 	Oh, o.k.

[pause 8sec]

T: 	Excellent.

S: 	And then

[pause 14sec]

[inaudible]

T: 	Excellent.

S: 	So

T: 	And now the weight of the object you know how to get from the mass and g.

S: 	Yes.

T: 	O.k. Now it’s just a plug in, As long as you’re careful. Well you still have to substitute for the asuby, but.

S: 	asuby, there’s a lot of solving in here.

T: 	Well just go up one, two, three, four lines.

S: 	Yeah, I see. I see. O.k. What I’ll do is put the values in for each one and solve for like asuby and in my head or with a calculator. So, you know the mass is sixty. We are using the entire mass.

T: 	Are you?

S: 	Eww.

T: 	Read part B again.

S: 	No. We’re using only one.

T: 	You’re using only one. Right.

S: 	The magnitude of

T: 	You’re talking about the force on an object which is just the top block equals the acceleration of the object times the mass of just that object. This whole top block.

S: 	O.k. Acceleration in the y-direction is uh,

[pause 9sec]

T: 	You might want to do a parenthesis here because there’s a minus sign.

[pause 7sec]

S: 	I got 3.5

T: 	That was by taking 5.9 times sine thirty-seven.

S: 	Yes

T: 	O.k. 3.5 meters per second squared.

[pause 5sec]

S: 	And then we have one more thing. We have the weight which we are adding on.

T: 	Uh-huh

S: 	And that is simply

[pause 5sec]

Thirty times 9.8

T: 	Uh-huh.

S: 	294 Newtons.

T: 	Uh-huh.

S: 	So we can just go ahead and solve for N then.

T: 	Uh-huh.

S: 	Do a little calculator punching.

T: 	Is the tape still running?

E: 	Uh-huh. Yeah.

T: 	O.k.

[pause or inaudible 12 sec]

S: 	O.k. We got 190 Newtons.

T: 	

[pause 6sec]

Sounds great to me.

S: 	So that’s the normal force that acting on the top block.

T: 	What? That’s the Go ahead. I just couldn’t hear.

S: 	I said normal force that is acting on the top block due to the bottom block.

T: 	That’s excellent. So that’s your answer for part B. You know maybe we should put- Maybe there should be some way to mark answer for part B or something.

S: 	What do you mean?

T: 	Just a comment about when the system is more developed to be a star that line and say, you know, computer look at this and see if this is the answer for part B.

S: 	Uh-huh.

T: 	To let it know you think you’re done.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	It’s not a note to you. It’s a note to the future developers of this system when they’re listening to these tapes.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. So that’s part B.

 

Problem 3c

T: 	So we’re done with that and now part C.

S: 	How many forces act on the top block?

T: 	Right. And I’m going to add my own

[inaudible]

which is what are they?

S: 	You mean like.

T: 	Like the normal force and the weight are two of them

S: 	O.k.

[pause 5sec]

Oh, wow.

[pause 8sec]

There’s uh, I guess the force of the surface of the bottom block.

T: 	Uh-huh.

S: 	Then.

T: 	Good. The normal force and the weight act in what directions?

S: 	The normal force and the weight act in opposite directions on the y-axis.

T: 	Uh-huh. And which way is the acceleration?

S: 	Acceleration is down the plane.

T: 	Yeah. It’s down and to the left so it’s partially on the y axis and partially on the x-axis. So can forces along the y-axis ever produce and acceleration along the x-axis?

S: 	Yes.

T: 	No.

S: 	Or no, oh, no o.k

T: 	No matter.

S: 	Because.

T: 	No matter how many books I pile up on a pile on a flat surface, they’re never going to slide sideways. You have to push them sideways to make them go sideways. There has to be a sideways push on that block.

S: 	So what is it? As these are sliding down, they are moving in the x-direction.

T: 	Uh-huh. They are moving together. What makes the top block move sideways?

S: 	The top block moves sideways. Is it that it’s not moving in the x-direction.

T: 	Well, if it wasn’t moving in the x-direction, the bottom block would slide out from under it. But they’re specified to be moving together.

S: 	Because it stopped and it’s not going to move again unless there’s a force acting on it.

T: 	Well it is going to move sideways. We’re told that they’re going to move together.

S: 	The friction between the two blocks.

T: 	The friction between the two block. It’s either- Friction is the simple answer. They could also be glues together or something.

S: 	Yeah.

T: 	O.k I would say friction probably. O.k. So the friction between the two blocks move the top block sideways. So what’s the answer to part C if you count the normal force and the frictional force as separate forces? You count them as one force, the contact force, but we already identified what’s the normal force.

S: 	So there’s three at least.

T: 	Uh-huh. There’s three at least. There’s three significant ones and we assume for simplicity that it’s just going to be three. We leave out air-resistance or something because it’s not specified that there is any. You never complicate- you never add complications to the problem that are not specified.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. Any questions or comments about this one?

S: 	No, now in a realistic situation if the friction was not enough, the force between

T: 	Then it would slide out.

S: 	It would slide out.

T: 	Yeah. Take something on your hand and move your hand down and sideways. If you move it fast enough or if it is slippery enough, it will fly out of your hand. If you do it slowly it will go with it. But if I do it too fast, I make that acceleration to big, then the friction is not enough to keep up.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	Do the actual experiment yourself. Don’t drop anything valuable, but do the actual experiment yourself.

S: 	O.k. I don’t have anything right with me right now.

T: 	Get a calculator.

S: 	That’s pretty valuable.

T: 	You might not want to drop it.

[pause 9sec]

S: 	Going down. I’m going to pretend that I’m going down an inclined plane to the right of myself so

T: 	O.k Yeah. If you with low acceleration, it will go with it, but if you go higher, with out going too high, without going so fast that it actually jerks out you hand actually leaves the thing so it will slide.

S: 	Well, this book’s pretty heavy so I don’t think it’ll go.

T: 	Well if you go fast enough, it will slide. Trust me. If you accelerate your hand enough, it will slide.

S: 	Yeah. It did slightly. If I go faster, it will do it even more. O.k.

T: 	Yeah. If there’s not enough friction to make it accelerate sideways, it will slide relative to your hand. O.k. So we can go on I think unless you want to take a five minute break and walk around.

S: 	Sure

E: 	Sure. Let’s take a break.

T: 	O.k

 

Problem 4

E: 	And we got the digital cassette recorder going so we’re ready to move on to the next problem. Problem four.

[pause 8sec]

T: 	O.k. Look at this for a minute and

[inaudible]

if you’ve ever seen a problem like this before.

S: 	Have I?

T: 	Uh-huh

S: 	Are those two weights being hung from strings that held together by

T: 	That’s exactly what this is supposed to represent. It’s annoying sometimes when they don’t explain these things. It’s a very conceptualized picture. O.k. Each of those weights is hanging from a string or cable. The cable or strings are assumed to be extremely light and have essentially no weight or stretch to them. And they don’t bend. They hang straight. They’re not exactly like real strings, but this is a fairly good approximation. O.k. And the strings are mounted in a ceiling somehow. Nothing in the system is moving. There’s no motion indicated.

S: 	What is Tsub2 a board or a rope or

T: 	Tsub2, T2 means tension in the rope there. There’s a rope there and T2 is the tension in it. T3 is the tension in the rope that it’s next to. T1 is the tension in the rope that it’s next to. And tension, tension isn’t measured in the same units as force. It’s not quite the same thing as force, but a rope under tension exerts a force at each end that’s equal to the tension at that point of the rope. In a massless rope like this, the tension is constant.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. So at the top of the rope, there’s a force pulling down on the ceiling. At the top of the rope, there’s a force pulling up on that knot.

S: 	Uh-huh

T: 	O.k. Does this all make sense?

S: 	Yes.

T: 	So you have a good mental picture of what’s going on. O.k. Now tell me if you have any idea of what to do next. A strategy Think about it for a minute and if you’re stuck, I’ll help you out.

S: 	Well we know weight, the weight one.

T: 	Uh-huh

S: 	And I guess we could break it up into x and y-components and

T: 	Break what up into x and y-components?

S: 	The weight, the weight one.

T: 	Uh-huh. What would be a good coordinate system? I think that the obvious one is a good one here because the weights are pulling straight down and the Ts are pulling straight across.

S: 	It would be just a right hand one like.

T: 	Or a non tilted one.

S: 	Yeah. Here, I’ll draw one.

T: 	O.k. That’s excellent. O.k. So now you want to find- You know W1 and you know intuitively that’s the variable related to what? What quantities is W1 going to be related to in this system?

S: 	Um, What is W1 going to be?

T: 	Yes.

S: 	It’s

[pause 4 sec]

The upward force on weight one.  

T: 	Yes. W1 is weight one and it’s equal to the tension in the string which

[inaudible]

S: 	Oh, yeah

T: 	It’s also the downward force on the knot. Where T2, T3 meet. The rope that connects W1 to the weight

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. So when you have a knot like that where three ropes meet, the what’s holding those ropes isn’t a force. Physics is local by and large. Newtonian physics is very local.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. So the forces that meet at that knot are going to be related to each other. Since you’re trying to find T3 and T2, then you’re also trying to find W2 and T1, but you don’t need to worry about that just now.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	T2 and T3 are the first things to go for. And the way to do it in a statics problem like this is to look at the equation sum of the forces equals mass times acceleration. Now nothing in this whole problem is moving, so what’s the acceleration of any object?

S: 	Uh, you mean downward.

T: 	Uh, no Well in any direction.

S: 	Oh, force divided by its mass.

T: 	I’m not talking about the force of gravity or the acceleration of gravity, I’m talking about the object. Are any of them moving?

S: 	No.

T: 	O.k. And is there any change in velocity over time. You have to disassociate this idea of acceleration being downward. The acceleration is the acceleration of an object. You have some path and it’s change in velocity over time is the acceleration.

S: 	Uh-huh.

T: 	The acceleration of gravity is a completely different thing. Think of a force pulling down on objects. Just think of- In this physics class, don’t worry about issues if that’s the same as the acceleration of gravity or not. There’s a very tricky point. We can talk about general relativity after you’re out of this course and I won’t confuse you.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. An accelerated coordinate system Just think about. Inertial coordinate systems, In this coordinate system,

S: 	So basically

T: 	The ceiling is not moving and is your reference. Nothing else is moving.

S: 	What we could look at is just a bunch of vectors on a

T: 	Well the acceleration. Yes, we’re going use a bunch of vectors. The acceleration of any object in the system is what relative to the ceiling as our reference frame?

S: 	What is it’s acceleration?

T: 	What’s the acceleration of an object that’s not moving and it’s motion- It’s just continuing to sit there.

S: 	Zero

T: 	Zero Exactly right. So when you write down F equals ma Sum of the forces equals ma, what’s the right hand side of the equation going to be.

S: 	It’s going to be zero.

T: 	Right. So for a statics problem, We’re taking care of static equilibrium like this, sum of the forces equals zero for any object in the system And the important object at this point is the, to me, can you see what it’s going to be?

S: 	The important

T: 	Yeah. To find out what T3 and T2 are. What’s the object- What object are we going to look at?

S: 	Weight one.

T: 	We’re going to weight one If we just look at weight one, we’ll say the tension is- the tension in rope one is equal to the weight. That is important. But to get to T3, T2 we have to look at the connection point. Think of that knot where the three ropes meet as an object.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	O.k. A very low mass object of some mass m. On that object, the sum of the forces equals zero. On that knot, the sum of the forces equals zero.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	The vector sum T3 up and to the left T2 to the right and W1 pulling down is zero

S: 	O.k. So what you’re saying T3 wait

T: 	Yeah. T3 plus T2 plus W1

S: 	Equals zero

T: 	And zero. And maybe write in parenthesis next to that write vector equation something like that. Vectors Because we can’t, we don’t have an arrow key. We can’t write the arrow overhead like we’d like to.

S: 	O.k. So we’re talking because they’re vector and you add them all up, they’re zero.

T: 	Right. And now just go component by component and you can solve for T3 and T2. First look at- Look at the y-direction first.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	That’s where you’re known thing is. W1

S: 	It’s uh, 200 or 300 really. Our ysub1

T: 	Your yeah, W1 in the y-direction is minus 300 Newtons since it’s pulling down and you put y up

S: 	Wsuby

T: 	And we should actually Maybe I should make you go down there and draw forces at that knot and label them T3, T2, and W1, but you know which way they’d be pulling.

S: 	You mean this or

T: 	Yeah. You have a force up and to the left and that would be T3.

S: 	This one right here.

T: 	Well, well, point with your cursor.

S: 	This one right. Oh Isn’t this

T: 	That’s, that’s after the knot, which way is the force from the rope pulling? Not at W1, but at the knot, which way is the force from the rope pulling?

S: 	Nowhere. Oh, which one.

T: 	There’s the force from the rope that connects W1. Which way is that pulling on the knot? Is it pulling up as you’ve drawn it or is it pulling down?

S: 	It’s pulling up. Wait no, it’s

T: 	Think of physically being there at the- Put your hand where the knot is and imagine the weight hanging from it, which way is it going to pull on your hand?

S: 	Down.

T: 	Down. Exactly

S: 	So, that then

T: 	So at that knot, the tension in that rope pulls down. At W1 it pulls up. Tension always pulls toward the middle of a rope.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	And it’s equal in magnitude to W1 which you got if you wanted from F equals ma on W1. That’s so obvious, we don’t even need to do it, I think. It’s an equation.

S: 	So we can, uh find

[pause 5sec]

T: 	So, I’m going to let you fiddle with your, Looks like you need to fix things on the computer for a second.

S: 	You mean as far as

T: 	Yeah, you can just write a new equation. I don’t care about deleting the other one. That arrow, we want to fix the direction it’s pointing.

[pause 18sec]

You should just, you should just name that W1, but that’s fine you can call it W1suby too.

S: 	O.k.

T: 	And T3 pulls up and to the left and T2 pulls straight to the right.

S: 	Wouldn’t T2 be W1subx? Would it be the x-component of the

T: 	Well W1 has no x-component. It just pulls straight down. So you’ll see when you write down the equations carefully how it comes out.

S: 	O.k.

[pause 3sec]

Now Can I, uh

T: 	Go ahead.

S: 	I was just going to draw something what I thought maybe- Off to the side here I was going to draw a

T: 	What's that?

S: 	Tsub3. Now if you total

T: 	Which way is T3 pulling on the knot. Is it pulling up and to the left or down and to the right?

S: 	It’s pulling up.

T: 	Uh-huh.

S: 	So

[pause 11sec]

T: 	So half the time you’re spending here is just getting the computer to behave properly.

S: 	O.k. What I was going to is Tsub3- The vectors Tsub3 and Tsub2 and weight one would all combine to like make a triangle.

T: 	That’s exactly true. Yeah. Yeah. That was discovered by a guy name Steban before.

[inaudible]

He figured out statics. Yes they would have combined exactly to make a triangle.

S: 	And I was wondering if I just draw that or something, or just so we look at

T: 	Well that’s the same thing as... Saying that they make a triangle is the same thing as saying T3 plus T2 plus W1 vector notation equals zero.

S: 	Yes.

T: 	Good. That’s just a graphical statement of the same thing. So I would just T3 up along that rope and T2 up along its rope show them coming all out from the same point rather than trying to make them into a triangle.

S: 	Oh, you mean draw them.

T: 	Oh you could, you could make them into a triangle. I see what you mean.

S: 	I mean move weight one

T: 	Uh-huh.
